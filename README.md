## Introduction

The LaCT project aims to improve test-time training techniques in machine learning. Our approach provides a robust framework that enhances model performance during inference. This repository serves as a practical guide to replicate our findings and apply our methods to your projects.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can visit our [Releases section](https://github.com/wristly/LaCT/releases) to download the latest version of the code. Make sure to follow the instructions below to set up your environment.

## Installation

To install the necessary packages and dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wristly/LaCT.git
   cd LaCT
   ```

2. **Install required libraries:**

   Use pip to install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the release:**

   Head to our [Releases section](https://github.com/wristly/LaCT/releases) to download the code. Execute the downloaded file to set up the application.

## Usage

After installation, you can use the LaCT framework for your machine learning tasks. The main command to run the model is:

```bash
python main.py --config config.yaml
```

### Configuration

You can modify the `config.yaml` file to adjust parameters like learning rate, batch size, and model architecture. Hereâ€™s a sample configuration:

```yaml
model:
  type: "CNN"
  layers: 5
training:
  epochs: 50
  batch_size: 32
```

## Features

- **Enhanced Performance:** Our methods provide significant improvements in model accuracy during test-time training.
- **Easy Integration:** The framework is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing machine learning workflows.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Detailed documentation is provided to help users understand the implementation.

## Examples

To illustrate how to use the LaCT framework, we provide several examples:

1. **Basic Usage:**

   Run the following command to train your model with the default configuration:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Custom Configuration:**

   Modify the configuration file as needed and run:

   ```bash
   python main.py --config custom_config.yaml
   ```

3. **Visualizing Results:**

   After training, you can visualize the results using:

   ```bash
   python visualize.py --results results.json
   ```
